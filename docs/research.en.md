Our mission is to advance Generative AI (Gen AI) to enhance productivity and benefit as many people as possible across various sectors of society and industry. We believe that improving Gen AI is not only about generating high-quality image or text, but rather this is about understanding how people interact with AI and how their actual work and life.

We focus on developing intuitive, efficient, and controllable models that accurately reflect user intentions, driving innovation at scale. Our research revolves around four core pillars:

---

### Gen AI for Everyone
We focus on the technical foundations that make Gen AI accessible and useful for all users, regardless of their technical expertise. Our research aims to bridge the gap between complex foundation models and end-user requirements through:

(1) **Controllable Generation**: Developing fine-grained steerability and alignment techniques to make Gen AI outputs precisely match user intent.<br>
(2) **Efficient Architectures**: Designing lightweight and scalable generative models to enable widespread deployment across various platforms.<br>
(3) **Human-Centric Design**: Engineering intuitive interfaces and interaction paradigms that prioritize technical accessibility and ease of use.

### AI Transformation (AX) by Gen AI
We drive AI Transformation (AX) by adapting cutting-edge Gen AI technologies to various industrial and social sectors. Our goal is to empower specialized domains that have yet to fully realize the benefits of Gen AI such as manufactoring, logistics and healthcare. 

(1) **Bespoke Adaptation**: Engineering methodologies to tailor large-scale foundation models for specialized fields requiring high-fidelity and domain-specific knowledge.<br>
(2) **Domain-Specific Workflows**: Creating integrated AI solutions that address the unique challenges of diverse sectors to build reliable performance in real-world environments.

### Creative AI
We strive to revolutionize the creative process in art and media by seamlessly integrating Generative AI into professional workflows. Our goal is to empower creators rather than replace them; by redefining AI as a powerful collaborative partner, we enable artists to transcend routine tasks and focus on the essence of innovation and artistic expression.

(1) **Productivity Augmentation**: Developing tools that automate repetitive tasks and enhance creative output (e.g., Cartooner, DreamStyler).<br>
(2) **Media Innovation**: Exploring new frontiers in content generation, such as stylized image synthesis and interactive media production (e.g., WebtoonMe).

### Responsible AI
As Gen AI becomes more prevalent, we are dedicated to mitigating its potential negative societal impacts. We develop robust technical frameworks to ensure that Gen AI is deployed safely, ethically, and securely.

(1) **Data Security & Privacy**: Researching Machine Unlearning and privacy-preserving techniques to prevent sensitive data leakage and protect user information.<br>
(2) **IP Protection**: Developing methods to prevent copyright infringement and safeguard the intellectual property of professional artists (e.g., Impasto).<br>
(3) **Ethical Deployment**: Creating mechanisms for AI-generated content detection and ensuring ethical alignment throughout the model lifecycle.
